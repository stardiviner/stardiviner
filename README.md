  I'm <a href="http://stardiviner.github.io/">stardiviner</a>, who like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a> and <a href="http://www.clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. A person who like to know and understand many different things which might have conflict thought and experience. I want to have a happy life belongs to myself. Like coding alone in room to write some programs I'm interested in. Spend time on my hobby and good people instead of wasting time on the annoying social interpersonal relationships. Anyway, I'm good at thinking about things' essential nature and discover new functionality of stuffs. No standards of good or evil. Just on personal judgement. So I have very strong personal opinions. This is the base of communication if you can aware of it.</p>
